How to fix Ubuntu system when it won’t boot?

Ubuntu doesn’t offer the Safe Mode and Automatic Repair tools you’ll find in Windows, but it does offer a recovery menu and a reinstall option that keeps your files and programs.
If you can’t boot anything — not even a USB drive or CD — you may need to configure the boot order in your<b> BIOS</b>. If this doesn’t help, there may be a hardware problem with your computer.
Check if you can access 'GRUB boot loader' (press Shift key on booting to see list of OS). If you can’t see it, GRUB may have been overwritten. Need Ubuntu installation disk to repair it. Should boot normally after that.
Use recovery mode if you can access. Pick “Advanced”, then “recovery mode”, then pick a tool for automatic repair of broken software packages, fix file system errors etc. or access root shell prompt to fix problem by hand if you know how.
if there’s a problem with your installed Ubuntu system, you should still be able to boot up an Ubuntu live CD or USB drive. Boot to the live media and start installing Ubuntu. Ubuntu should find your existing installation and give you a “Reinstall Ubuntu” option. When you perform a reinstall, the installer will keep all your personal files and settings. It will even keep your installed software packages, if possible. The Reinstall option will wipe away all your system-wide settings and return them to their defaults, but that should fix problems that misconfigured system settings could cause.
